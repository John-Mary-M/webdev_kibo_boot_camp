      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is John Mary, the web dev you have been searching for.
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
          <p>
                I am a season full stack who trained as a software engineer and majored in Front-End development.
                That said i wasn't always a web developer, in the early years of my career i was an audio engineer
                and also doubled as a music & English teacher. Things changed after the COVID pandemic hit my country
                <strong>I was laid off</strong> so i decided to study something i could do anywhere in the world whether
                remote or in person. I wanted to make sure my skills can never become depricated again. Things in tech evolve
                every few months and that was the push. If my skills are up to date, as a contractor, or freelancer or employee
                i can always be of use then.
          </p>
